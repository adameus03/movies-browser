### Run movies data server
~~For the application to work properly, it needs to fetch data from a movies.json file server.
The script for running such server is stored at data/movies.js~~
Optionally it is possible to run a simple movies.json data server, however it is currently not used by the application.
To run the data server, just navigate to the data directory and run
```
node movies.js
```
